# Infinite RPG

Embark on a never-ending adventure in a world crafted by AI. Explore, battle, and become a legend in an RPG that's different every time you play. Powered by Google's Gemini, this project showcases a unique, procedurally generated gaming experience right in your browser.

## ✨ Features

*   **Procedurally Generated World**: Explore a unique world map in every playthrough, complete with distinct locations, biomes, and connecting paths, all generated by the Gemini API.
*   **Context-Aware Narrative**: A sophisticated **Journal System** tracks your quests and hidden narrative "flags". The AI remembers your actions—whether you stole an apple or saved a king—ensuring that your choices have long-term consequences on future events.
*   **Immersive Audio**: Listen to the story unfold with **AI Text-to-Speech** narration powered by Gemini, bringing a dungeon master's voice to your adventure.

*   **AI-Powered Character Creation**: Bring your hero to life! Describe your character's appearance, choose a class, and the AI will generate a unique 16-bit pixel art portrait.
*   **Deep, Tactical RPG Combat**: Engage in classic turn-based battles against a bestiary of AI-generated monsters.
    *   **Class Abilities**: Go beyond basic attacks! Warriors can unleash an **Earthen Strike**, Mages can cast **Fireball** or **Ice Shard**, and Rogues can perform a **Lightning Strike**.
    *   **Social Combat**: Use the **Befriend** ability to attempt to resolve conflicts peacefully with non-humanoid entities, relying on your **Charisma** and **Luck**.
    *   **Advanced Enemy AI**: Face foes with unique abilities (Heal, Shield, Drain Life) and distinct combat personalities (Aggressive, Defensive, Strategic, Wild).
    *   **Status Effects**: Manage tactical conditions like Burn, Chill, Shock, and Grounded.
*   **Dynamic Social Encounters**: Not every problem is solved with a sword. Navigate AI-generated social scenarios, make choices, and face the consequences, earning unique rewards (XP, Items, or Quests) along the way.
*   **Robust Character Progression**: 
    *   **Attributes**: Customize your **Strength**, **Intelligence**, **Agility**, and **Charisma**.
    *   **Luck**: A derived stat that influences critical hits and social success.
    *   **Crafting**: Gather materials and craft powerful potions, weapons, and armor.
