# Infinite JRPG

Embark on a never-ending adventure in a world crafted by AI. Explore, battle, and become a legend in a JRPG that's different every time you play. Powered by Google's Gemini, this project showcases a unique, procedurally generated gaming experience right in your browser.

## ✨ Features

*   **Procedurally Generated World**: Explore a unique world map in every playthrough, complete with distinct locations, biomes, and connecting paths, all generated by the Gemini API.
*   **Context-Aware Narrative**: A sophisticated **Journal System** tracks your quests and hidden narrative "flags". The AI remembers your actions—whether you stole an apple or saved a king—ensuring that your choices have long-term consequences on future events.
*   **Endless Exploration & Story**: Every location you visit has a unique, AI-generated description and set of actions. Uncover new scenarios, find hidden items, and stumble upon unexpected events. No two adventures are the same!
*   **AI-Powered Character Creation**: Bring your hero to life! Describe your character's appearance, choose a class, and the AI will generate a unique 16-bit pixel art portrait.
*   **Deep, Tactical JRPG Combat**: Engage in classic turn-based battles against a bestiary of AI-generated monsters.
    *   **Class Abilities**: Go beyond basic attacks! Warriors can land a **Heavy Strike**, Mages can cast **Fireball**, and Rogues can perform a **Quick Strike**.
    *   **Advanced Enemy AI**: Face foes with unique abilities (Heal, Shield, Drain Life) and distinct combat personalities (Aggressive, Defensive, Strategic, Wild).
*   **Dynamic Social Encounters**: Not every problem is solved with a sword. Navigate AI-generated social scenarios, make choices, and face the consequences, earning unique rewards (XP, Items, or Quests) along the way.
*   **Robust Character Progression**: Choose from three classes: the sturdy **Warrior**, the powerful **Mage**, or the nimble **Rogue**. Level up, increase your stats, and find powerful loot to grow stronger.
*   **Save Your Progress**: Your epic journey is saved in your browser's local storage. You can close the game at any time and pick up right where you left off.
