Embark on a never-ending adventure in a world crafted by AI. Explore, battle, and become a legend in a JRPG that's different every time you play. Powered by Google's Gemini, this game offers a unique, procedurally generated experience right in your browser.

## ✨ Features

*   **Truly Infinite Exploration**: The world, its descriptions, encounters, and items are all procedurally generated by the Gemini API, offering endless replayability. No two adventures are the same!
*   **AI-Powered Character Creation**: Bring your hero to life! Describe your character's appearance, and the AI will generate a unique 16-bit pixel art portrait for them.
*   **Classic JRPG Combat**: Engage in tactical, turn-based battles against a bestiary of unique, AI-generated monsters. Exploit their weaknesses and use your skills to emerge victorious.
*   **Deep Character Progression**: Choose from classic classes like the sturdy **Warrior**, the powerful **Mage**, or the nimble **Rogue**. Level up, increase your stats, and find powerful loot to grow stronger.
*   **Save Your Progress**: Your epic journey is saved in your browser's local storage. You can close the game at any time and pick up right where you left off.
